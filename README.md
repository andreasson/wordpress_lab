Prerequisites
---------------

How to use
---------------

If your docker daemon is running on another machine, please adjust the wp_host_ip in settings.properties to the corresponding ip.

To start wordpress and initiate it run:

```initiate_wordpress```


When that is done you should be able to access the instance at:

[http://wp_host_ip:8080](http://wp_host_ip:8080).

Now you can submit a new blogpost about something amazing. Just run:

```post_page```

and answer the questions.

ThatÂ´s all folks.
